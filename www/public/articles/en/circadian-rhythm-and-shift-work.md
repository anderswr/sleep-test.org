# Circadian rhythm & shift work: when sleep timing feels off

Not all sleep problems are caused by poor habits.  
For many people, sleep difficulties stem from a mismatch between their internal clock and the demands of daily life.

## What is the circadian rhythm?

The circadian rhythm is the body’s internal clock that regulates sleep and wakefulness across a 24-hour cycle.  
It is strongly influenced by light exposure, activity, and consistent routines.

Health authorities describe the circadian rhythm as a core biological system affecting sleep, alertness, and overall health  
([CDC](https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2016/10/05/shift-work-and-sleep/)).

## Evening types are not doing it “wrong”

Some people naturally feel more alert in the evening and later at night.  
Trying to sleep earlier than the body is ready for can lead to:

- Long sleep onset time  
- Light or fragmented sleep  
- Feeling unrefreshed in the morning  

These patterns often reflect **chronotype differences**, not poor sleep discipline  
([National Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm)).

## Shift work and sleep disruption

Night shifts and rotating schedules place heavy strain on the circadian system.  
The body may receive conflicting signals about when to be awake and when to sleep.

According to the CDC, shift work is associated with:
- Shorter and less restorative sleep  
- Increased daytime sleepiness  
- Greater difficulty recovering between shifts

## Practical tips

- **Use light strategically**: Bright light when you need to be alert, dim light before sleep. Light is the strongest signal for resetting the body clock  
  ([American Academy of Sleep Medicine](https://sleepeducation.org/patients/bright-light-therapy)).  
- **Anchor your wake-up time**: Keeping a relatively stable wake time, even on days off, helps stabilize the rhythm.  
- **Nap carefully**: Short naps (15–25 minutes) early in the wake period may help; long or late naps can backfire.  
- **Be mindful with caffeine**: Use it early in your wake period and avoid it close to planned sleep.

## Important to remember

Irregular sleep does not always mean something is wrong.  
Often, it reflects a natural rhythm or work-related demands — and benefits from tailored strategies rather than stricter rules.

---

## Key takeaway

Sleep timing problems are often about rhythm, not willpower.  
Understanding your circadian clock can help you choose strategies that work *with* your biology, not against it.
