# Sleep pattern & duration: a routine that works

We often hear that “sleeping enough” matters. But *when* and *how regularly* you sleep is just as important as the number of hours.  
A stable routine helps your body clock (circadian rhythm) know when to be alert and when to wind down. Without it, you may feel like you are always “jet lagged” — even without travel.

## Why regularity matters

Your brain and body thrive on rhythm. Going to bed and waking up at roughly the same time every day anchors your biological clock.  
Irregular schedules, especially “social jet lag” (staying up late and sleeping in on weekends), can make Mondays harder, reduce alertness, and even impact long-term health.

## How much sleep is enough?

Most adults need **7–9 hours per night**. Some feel fine on 7, others need closer to 9. Less than 6 hours is rarely enough over time, and more than 10 may signal something else going on.  
What matters is waking refreshed, not fighting fatigue all day.

## Smart naps (but not too late)

A short nap can boost alertness, but timing matters:
- Keep it **20–30 minutes max**.
- Best before 3 pm.
- Too long or too late? You risk delaying nighttime sleep.

## Practical tips to improve your pattern

- **Protect your sleep window**: Give yourself at least 7 hours in bed, consistently.
- **Stick to a steady wake-up time**: Even on weekends — or within 30–60 minutes.
- **Build a wind-down**: A simple 30–60 min pre-bed routine signals your body to switch gears.
- **Be mindful with naps**: Short and early is the sweet spot.

## Key takeaway

A strong sleep routine isn’t about perfection — it’s about **consistency**. Protect enough time, go to bed and wake up at similar times, and keep naps smart. Small steps add up quickly.
