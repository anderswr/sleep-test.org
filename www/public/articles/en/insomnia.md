# Insomnia: when nights feel too long

Struggling to fall asleep, waking up often, or waking too early?  
That’s insomnia — one of the most common sleep issues. Almost everyone has a rough night now and then, but when it becomes frequent, it can affect mood, energy, and health.

## What is insomnia?

Insomnia isn’t just “not sleeping enough.” It’s about:
- **Difficulty falling asleep** (taking a long time to drift off).
- **Frequent awakenings** during the night.
- **Early morning waking** without being able to fall back asleep.
- **Poor rest** even after a full night.

Short-term insomnia often comes from stress, travel, or life changes. Long-term insomnia lasts more than three nights a week for at least three months.

## Why it matters

Poor sleep chips away at mental sharpness, mood, and physical health.  
Chronic insomnia increases the risk of anxiety, depression, heart disease, and accidents ([NIH](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/insomnia)).

## What helps?

The most effective treatment is often **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)**. It helps break the cycle of frustration, bad habits, and sleep worry. But there are also steps you can try yourself:

- **Stimulus control**: Use your bed only for sleep and intimacy — not TV, work, or doomscrolling.
- **Rule of 20 minutes**: If you can’t sleep, get up, do something calm in dim light, and try again later.
- **Fixed wake-up time**: Keep a steady morning anchor, even after bad nights.
- **Wind-down routine**: Gentle activities (reading, music, stretching) tell your body it’s time for bed.
- **Avoid sleep pressure traps**: Spending more and more time in bed often backfires.

## When to seek help

If sleep problems last more than a few weeks, or you notice big impacts on daily life, talk to a doctor. They can help check for underlying conditions and guide you to CBT-I or other treatments.

## Key takeaway

Insomnia is frustrating — but it’s not hopeless. By resetting habits, limiting bed to sleep, and keeping a steady rhythm, most people can improve. For lasting issues, CBT-I is the gold standard.
