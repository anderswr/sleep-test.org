# Sleep hygiene: the habits that shape your nights

Good sleep is not just about how many hours you spend in bed — it’s also about **the routines and signals you give your body**.  
This is where *sleep hygiene* comes in: the everyday habits that either support or sabotage your sleep.

## Why sleep hygiene matters

Your brain and body rely on clear signals to know when it’s time to rest.  
If those signals are mixed — like bright screens, caffeine late in the day, or inconsistent bedtimes — falling and staying asleep becomes harder.  

Poor sleep hygiene often leads to:
- Longer time to fall asleep  
- More awakenings during the night  
- Feeling less rested in the morning

## Core principles of good sleep hygiene

- **Keep consistent times**: Go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time, even on weekends.  
- **Wind down before bed**: 30–60 minutes of calm routines (dim lights, reading, gentle music).  
- **Limit screens**: Blue light and stimulation delay sleepiness — switch to screen-free or “night mode.”  
- **Watch caffeine and nicotine**: Both are stimulants that can linger for hours. Stop caffeine after ~2–4 pm.  
- **Skip alcohol as a sleep aid**: It may make you drowsy, but it disrupts deep sleep and causes early awakenings.  
- **Light evening meals**: Heavy food late can cause discomfort and poor sleep.

## Tips for a better bedtime routine

- Create a **“bedtime ritual”** — repeating the same calming activities trains your body to expect sleep.  
- Keep the **bed for sleep (and intimacy)** only — not for TV, work, or scrolling.  
- Try gentle stretches, breathing exercises, or journaling to let go of stress.

## When habits aren’t enough

If you’ve improved your sleep hygiene but still suffer from insomnia, it may be time for further steps, such as **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)** — the gold-standard, evidence-based treatment ([American Academy of Sleep Medicine](https://aasm.org/)).

## Key takeaway

Good sleep hygiene is about **consistency, timing, and signals**.  
By aligning your habits with your body’s natural rhythms, you make it easier to fall asleep, stay asleep, and wake refreshed.
