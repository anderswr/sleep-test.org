# Social Media vs. Research: What Actually Works?

## 1. ASMR, Sleep Stories & “Just the Voice”
**From Reddit:**  
> “I listen to sleep stories. My favorite story is Land of Nod … it’s not the story I like, it’s the voice.” ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/comments/1kt4qjv/what_are_your_weird_tips_for_falling_asleep-fast))  

**Research:** Social media is full of such tips, and TikTok studies show that “soothing activities” do have some scientific backing ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2024/06/03/most-sleep-tips-on-tiktok-are-supported-by-science-study)).

## 2. Screen Time & Night Mode
**From research:**  
Using a phone before bed increases the risk of poor sleep—especially after more than 30 minutes. Blue light suppresses melatonin and disrupts circadian rhythms ([sleepfoundation.org](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/blue-light)).  

**Modern tip:** Night mode and blue light filters can help reduce sleep onset time, but nothing beats turning the screen off completely.
