# Stress & racing thoughts: when the mind won’t switch off

Feeling tired but unable to fall asleep is a common experience.  
Stress, worry, and racing thoughts are among the most frequent causes of difficulty falling asleep — even when sleep habits are otherwise good.

## Why mental stress affects sleep

Sleep requires the brain and body to shift into a calm, low-alert state.  
Stress does the opposite.

When you’re under pressure, the body activates its alert system: heart rate increases, muscles tense, and attention sharpens. This state — often called **hyperarousal** — makes it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep.

Sleep researchers describe this as a key mechanism behind insomnia  
([American Academy of Sleep Medicine](https://aasm.org/resources/factsheets/insomnia.pdf)).

## Common signs

- **Racing thoughts** when going to bed  
- **Long time to fall asleep**, despite feeling tired  
- **Frequent awakenings** with a restless or tense feeling  
- **Sleep problems that worsen during stressful periods**  
- **Daytime effects** like poor focus, low energy, or irritability  

According to the National Institutes of Health, this combination of nighttime symptoms and daytime impairment is typical of stress-related insomnia  
([NIH](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/insomnia)).

## Why good sleep habits may not be enough

Sleep hygiene — limiting screens, keeping a regular bedtime, and having a quiet bedroom — is important.  
But when stress is the main driver, these steps alone may not resolve the problem.

That’s why approaches targeting mental activation, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), are considered first-line treatment for persistent insomnia  
([Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/insomnia/treatment/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-for-insomnia)).

## Practical tips

- **Wind down intentionally**: Allow 45–60 minutes before bed for calm, low-demand activities.  
- **Write worries down**: Listing concerns or tasks earlier in the evening can reduce nighttime rumination  
  ([NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/tips-and-support/how-to-manage-stress/)).  
- **Slow your breathing**: Longer exhales can help activate the body’s calming response.  
- **Get out of bed if you’re wide awake**: Doing something quiet until sleepiness returns helps retrain the brain to associate bed with sleep, not worry.

## When to seek help

If sleep problems persist for weeks, significantly affect daily functioning, or don’t improve with self-care, it may be helpful to speak with a healthcare professional.

## Key takeaway

Stress and racing thoughts are powerful sleep disruptors.  
If your mind won’t switch off at night, the solution may lie not in stricter sleep rules — but in helping your body and brain slow down.
