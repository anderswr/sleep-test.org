# Sleep questionnaire scoring extract

This extract was generated from the repository source files listed in the Metadata sheet.

Notes:
- The Excel file was generated using a minimal XLSX writer implemented with the Python standard library (no external XLSX packages were available in the environment).
- All questionnaire and report text values in the workbook come from the English locale file (public/locales/en.json).
- I18n_All_Translations contains every key/value pair across all locale JSON files.
- I18n_Translation_Sources lists locale file locations (file path + line number) for each translation key.
